### Internal links

With internal links, you can link to other pages in your Obsidian vault.
If you want, you can also link to specific sections within a page.

[[Link to a page in Obsidian|Custom text]]
[[Link to a section in Obsidian#section]]
````

# Advanced formatting

## Code

**Inline code** formatting starts and ends with 1 backtick and will look `like this`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
code = '`like this`'
cat(code)
```

**Code blocks** start and end with 3 backticks and can have a language specified for syntax highlighting.

````md
```r
# An R code snippet
mean(1:3)
```
````

becomes:

```r
# An R code snippet
mean(1:3)
```

## Equations

You can use LaTeX to write equations in your markdown notes.

Either, you can use **inline equations** like this: `$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$` which becomes $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

Or you can use **display equations** like this:

````md
$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx
$$
````

which becomes:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx
$$

## Embedded links

You can embed links images and videos, but also to other notes in your Obsidian vault.
Embedding a note will display the content of the note in your current note.

All you need to do to embed a note is to add an `!` in front of the link.

````md
![[Embedding a note]]
![Embedding a video](https://youtu.be/WPAV1SNkdFg?si=U5EWwFa5ji9UF6fJ)
````
